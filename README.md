# React Native Project Setups

## ðŸ“‚ Project Creation Steps

### 1. **Install Node.js**  
   Install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### 2. **Install Android Studio & SDK**  
   Download and install Android Studio, ensuring that you install the required SDKs and emulator for Android development.

### 3. **React Native Project Initialization**

   You have two options for initializing a React Native project:
   
   - **Using React Native CLI (Recommended for larger applications)**  
     First, make sure to install the React Native CLI globally:
     ```
     npm install -g react-native-cli
     ```
     Then, create your project:
     ```
     npx react-native init <ProjectName>
     ```
   
   - **Using Expo (Best for quick development, smaller apps, and cross-platform projects)**  
     Install Expo CLI globally:
     ```
     npm install -g expo-cli
     ```
     Then create your project:
     ```
     expo init <ProjectName>
     ```
     Expo provides a faster development cycle and many built-in APIs, but it may not be suitable for large apps or apps that require complex native code.

### 4. **Folder Structure**

   Once the project is created, navigate to the project folder and organize it as follows:

   ```
   <ProjectName>
   â”œâ”€â”€ android/               # Android-specific files
   â”œâ”€â”€ ios/                   # iOS-specific files
   â”œâ”€â”€ src/                   # All app-related code
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/            # Images, fonts, icons, etc.
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/        # Reusable UI components
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ screens/           # All screen components
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ navigation/        # App navigation (React Navigation)
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ redux/             # Redux store, slices, actions (if using Redux)
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/             # Custom hooks
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/             # Helper functions, constants
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/          # API calls, async storage
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ context/           # React Context API (if used)
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/            # Configurations (API keys, themes)
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles/            # Global styles (if using Styled Components)
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx            # Root component (move App.tsx to src folder)
   â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore             # Git ignore file
   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json           # Dependencies & scripts
   â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json          # TypeScript config (if using TypeScript)
   â”œâ”€â”€ babel.config.js        # Babel config
   â”œâ”€â”€ metro.config.js        # Metro bundler config
   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md              # Project documentation
   ```

## ðŸš€ **CLI vs Expo: Which is Better for Large Applications?**

### **React Native CLI**  
   - Best for large applications and projects that require custom native code or more advanced configuration.
   - Full control over the project, and you can add custom native modules easily.
   - Ideal for scaling applications and integrating with third-party native libraries.

### **Expo**  
   - Best for quick prototyping or smaller apps that don't require native code modifications.
   - Expo provides a lot of built-in APIs and an easy setup, but it has limitations when you need custom native code.
   - If you plan to scale your app significantly or need advanced native functionality, **React Native CLI** would be more suitable.
